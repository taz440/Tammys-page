                        I am an ordinary person who has a lot of hobbies (i suppose i have to having 6 kids) so all my hobbies are because of my kids. When i was very young i used to enjoy baking with my dad, that then progreesed to my love of baking cakes and sweet desserts. I have done several cake decorating courses and i am just on my last one.</p>
                    <p>
                        Again with having sooooooo many children i have a qualifercation in media make up and i am also currently doing a face painting course because what kid doesn't like face paint (not many thats for sure).

                        Once again back onto food, I love my food and I have to agree with my family that I am a feeder, which brings me onto. I think a good buffet is when you have food left over. No body wants to run out off food on a special occasion so I decided that I can give customers a lot of good quality food. If you want to cater for 110 people I wont say ok lets it down because not everyone will come or not everyone will eat. No I will cater for 110 people.

                        The final 2 things that I have learnt to do is coding and web design. I am no good with with technology but my husband and one of my sons are so i thought, why not just give it a go. It is only a 3 week course and it wont do my any harm.
                    </p>

                        Now can you believe it i actually enjoyed it, I can now code a txt base game and i have developed this web page on my own. I know I am as shocked as you.
